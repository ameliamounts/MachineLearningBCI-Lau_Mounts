# MachineLearningBCI-Lau_Mounts
Machine Learning and Brain Computer Interfaces (CS91.3) project. Can we use machine learning to accurately predict directions of movement from EEG recordings in a motor imagery task? What is the most effective and robust algorithm for classifying this data?


## Getting Started

You can download the BCI-IV competition (2a 4-class motor imagery) dataset in it's preprocessed form here: http://bnci-horizon-2020.eu/database/data-sets

Place all of the files into a folder called [INSERT FOLDER NAME HERE].

Prerequisites:
python3.6

numpy

sklearn

pyriemann

scipy

pytorch4.0


## Running the code

To run the code, use the main function.
